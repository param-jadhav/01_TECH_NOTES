1. Basic Application Logs Query
This query retrieves logs from your application indexed in Splunk.
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype

2. Error Monitoring
This query fetches all error logs from your application.
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype log_level=ERROR

3. Monitoring Specific Application Events
If you want to monitor specific events, like user logins or transactions:
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype event_type="user_login"

4. Performance Monitoring
To monitor the performance of your application, such as response times:
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype | stats avg(response_time) by endpoint

5. Dashboard for Real-Time Monitoring
To create a real-time monitoring dashboard:
a. Query for Real-Time Errors
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype log_level=ERROR | timechart count by error_message

b. Query for Response Times
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype | timechart avg(response_time) by endpoint

6. User Activity Monitoring
To track user activities:
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype | stats count by user_id

7. Alert Setup
Set up alerts for critical conditions. For example, alert on high error rates:
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype log_level=ERROR | stats count by error_mes

8.  request count based on a specific log message
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype "input request for login service"
| stats count as request_count

index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype "input request for login service"
| stats count as request_count by user_id

Example Result:
After running the query, you'll get a table with two columns: user_id and request_count.

user_id	request_count
user123	15
user456	8
user789	23

9.  I need query to filter some fields from the logs and i need count based on search. 
I want to filter devicetype, appsource, username, email i want to search this based on client name example GPT.
query:
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype client_name="GPT"
| stats count by devicetype, appsource, username, email

result:
devicetype	appsource	username	email	count
mobile	app1	user123	user123@example.com	10
desktop	app2	user456	user456@example.com	5
tablet	app1	user789	user789@example.com	7

Additional Filters:
If you need to add more specific filters or want to search logs within a particular time frame, you can enhance the query. 
For example, to limit the search to logs from the past 7 days:
query:
index=app_logs sourcetype=app_log client_name="GPT" earliest=-7d@d latest=now
| stats count by devicetype, appsource, username, email

Adding Field Extraction (if needed):
If the fields (devicetype, appsource, username, email, and client_name) are not automatically extracted in your logs, 
you might need to use rex to extract them.
Here is an example with rex:
query:
index=app_logs sourcetype=app_log
| rex field=_raw "client_name=(?P<client_name>[^ ]+)"
| rex field=_raw "devicetype=(?P<devicetype>[^ ]+)"
| rex field=_raw "appsource=(?P<appsource>[^ ]+)"
| rex field=_raw "username=(?P<username>[^ ]+)"
| rex field=_raw "email=(?P<email>[^ ]+)"
| search client_name="GPT"
| stats count by devicetype, appsource, username, email

Explanation of rex:
rex field=_raw "client_name=(?P<client_name>[^ ]+)": Extracts the client_name field from the raw log data.
Repeat similar rex commands for devicetype, appsource, username, and email.

search client_name="GPT": Filters logs to include only those where client_name is "GPT".
stats count by devicetype, appsource, username, email: Counts the occurrences of the logs, 
grouped by devicetype, appsource, username, and email.

10. Example Splunk Query for Monitoring Exceptions
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype "Exception" OR "Error"

index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype ("Exception" OR "Error" OR "Stacktrace" OR "Fail")
| stats count as exception_count by _time
| sort -_time

index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype ("Exception" OR "Error" OR "Stacktrace" OR "Fail")
| timechart span=1h count as exception_count

10. Splunk Query to Count HTTP Response Codes
index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype ("200" OR "401" OR "500")
| stats count as response_count by http_response_code

index=your_app_index sourcetype=your_app_sourcetype
| stats count as response_count by http_response_code
| where http_response_code IN ("200", "401", "500")

Basic Usage of spath
--------------------
In Splunk, the spath command is used to extract fields from structured data formats such as JSON, XML, 
or key-value pairs. It allows you to parse and extract specific values from these types of data within your logs or events.
1. Extract Fields from JSON
If your log data contains JSON-formatted fields, spath can be used to extract and work with those fields.
index=your_index sourcetype=your_sourcetype
| spath input=_raw
| table user action details.ip details.location



Example Log Data
Log Entries:

JSON Log Entry 1:

json
Copy code
{
  "user": "john_doe",
  "action": "login",
  "details": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "location": "New York"
  }
}
JSON Log Entry 2:

json
Copy code
{
  "user": "jane_smith",
  "action": "logout",
  "details": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.2",
    "location": "San Francisco"
  }
}
JSON Log Entry 3:

json
Copy code
{
  "user": "alice_johnson",
  "action": "login",
  "details": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.3",
    "location": "Chicago"
  }
}
Splunk Query
Query:

spl
Copy code
index=your_index sourcetype=your_sourcetype
| spath input=_raw
| table user action details.ip details.location
Example Result
Result Table:

user	action	details.ip	details.location
john_doe	login	192.168.1.1	New York
jane_smith	logout	192.168.1.2	San Francisco
alice_johnson	login	192.168.1.3	Chicago
Explanation of the Result
user: Displays the user name extracted from the JSON field user.
action: Shows the action performed by the user extracted from the JSON field action.
details.ip: Shows the IP address extracted from the nested JSON field details.ip.
details.location: Shows the location extracted from the nested JSON field details.location.
The spath command parses the JSON data from the _raw field and extracts the specified fields into a table format. This helps in visualizing and analyzing the data more effectively.






Query Breakdown
Query:

spl
Copy code
index=login_pcf_np "transid123"
| spath msg.message
| table _time cf_app_name msg.TransactionID msg.message
Explanation
index=login_pcf_np "transid123":

Searches the login_pcf_np index for events containing the string transid123.
| spath msg.message:

Parses the msg.message field if it contains structured data (e.g., JSON). This command will extract fields from the msg.message field based on its structure.
| table _time cf_app_name msg.TransactionID msg.message:

Creates a table showing the _time, cf_app_name, msg.TransactionID, and msg.message fields.
Correct Usage of spath
1. Ensure Correct Field Extraction:

If msg.message is a structured field (e.g., JSON) and you want to extract nested fields within it, make sure spath is properly used. Hereâ€™s an example assuming msg.message is JSON:

spl
Copy code
index=login_pcf_np "transid123"
| spath input=msg.message
| table _time cf_app_name msg.TransactionID msg.message.some_nested_field
2. Extract Nested Fields:

If msg.message is JSON and contains nested fields, you need to specify the paths to those fields. For example:

spl
Copy code
index=login_pcf_np "transid123"
| spath input=msg.message
| table _time cf_app_name msg.TransactionID msg.message.status msg.message.details
3. Check if Fields are Already Extracted:

If msg.TransactionID and msg.message are already extracted fields and not nested or structured data, you may not need spath. You can simplify the query:

spl
Copy code
index=login_pcf_np "transid123"
| table _time cf_app_name TransactionID msg.message


index=<your_index> source=<your_source> OR sourcetype=<your_sourcetype>
NOT (msg.message="TransmitException" OR msg.message="Credit Bureau Processing Exception" OR msg.message="Exception in Registration Flag Validation")
| rex field=msg.message "(?<exception_message>^[^\n]+)"
| stats count by exception_message
| sort -count


index=<your_index> source=<your_source> OR sourcetype=<your_sourcetype>
| rex field=msg.message "(?<exception_message>^[^\n]+)"
| stats count by exception_message
| sort -count

index=<your_index> source=<your_source> "api" (error OR exception)
| rex field=_raw "Exception:(?<exception>[^\n]+)"



| stats count by exception
| sort - county

index 
("Exception" OR "Error" OR "Failure" OR "Timeout" OR "Invalid" OR "Critical" OR "Not Found" OR "Rejected" OR "Unknown")
| rex field=_raw "(?i)(error|exception|failure|invalid|timeout|critical|not found|rejected|unknown|SQL Error|StackTrace):(?<error_details>[^\n]+)"
| stats count by error_details
| sort - count


| table error_details, count


index=source " 
("Exception" OR "Error" OR "credit.application.internalError" OR "credit bureau" OR "TimeoutException" OR "ConstraintViolationException")
| rex field=_raw "(?i)(Exception|Error|Timeout|Violation|InternalError|Critical|SQL Error|StackTrace):(?<error_details>[^\n]+)"
| stats count by error_details
| sort - count
| table error_details, count
